# GraphQuest: Exploring and Implementing GraphQL

# Character Queries

This project contains GraphQL queries to fetch details of characters using the `character(id: ID!)` field.

For each character (ids 1â€“4), the following fields are requested:
- `id`
- `name`
- `status`
- `species`
- `type`
- `gender`

Each query is stored in a `.graphql` file, and the corresponding results are stored in `.json` files.
